Category: Bread
Makes: 1 loaf

## Feed starter.

- Sourdough starter, 30 g: Existing, well-maintained.
- Flour (bread), 60 g
- Water, 60 g

Add some existing starter to a small bowl. Mix in flour and water.

Clean starter jar, then return mixture to it. Leave at room temperature until at least doubled.

## Make dough and bulk ferment.

- Sourdough starter, 100 g: From above.
- Water, 300 g
- Salt, 9 g
- Flour (bread), 450 g

Stir together starter, water, and salt.

Mix in flour and continue mixing until a shaggy dough forms. Allow to rest for a few minutes, then mix again until no dry spots remain.

Perform a few stretch and folds at half-hour intervals, until dough is strong and smooth.

Shape the dough into a neat ball and allow to rise until at least doubled. This will take around 4-8 hours.

## Shape, proof, and refrigerate.

Dust counter lightly with flour. Turn dough out onto counter. 

If making multiple loaves, portion accordingly. 

Pre-shape each portion into a smooth ball. Cover with a towel and let rest for 30 minutes.

Dust banneton(s) with flour, then shape each portion again and into a banneton.

Let proof for about 60 minutes, then place in refrigerator, uncovered.

## Bake.

- Cornmeal

Preheat the oven to 450°F convection roast.

Remove loaf from fridge and let it rest on the counter while the oven preheats.

Turn out the loaf out into the shallow side of a bread cloche. Score the top. Cover the cloche and transfer to oven.

Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the cover and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
