# Approved .html_safe / raw() calls.
#
# Each entry is "relative/path:line_number". The lint:html_safe rake task
# will fail if any .html_safe or raw() call is found that is NOT in this list.
#
# Before adding a new entry, verify the call is safe:
#   - All interpolated user content must be escaped with ERB::Util.html_escape
#   - Hardcoded values (integers, literal strings) are safe without escaping
#   - Renderer output (Redcarpet with escape_html: true) is safe
#   - ScalableNumberPreprocessor output is safe (escapes user content internally)

# RecipesHelper — renderer and preprocessor output (safe by construction)
- "app/helpers/recipes_helper.rb:7"     # render_markdown: Redcarpet with escape_html: true
