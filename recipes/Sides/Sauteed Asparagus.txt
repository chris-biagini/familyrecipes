# Sautéed Asparagus

Tender and garlicky.

## Prepare asparagus.

- Asparagus

If asparagus is very thick, peel it. ([Jacques Pepin can show you how.](https://jp.foundation/video/asparagus)).

Cutting on a bias, cut off the thick end of each stalk and discard. [Roll cut](https://madeincookware.com/blogs/how-to-roll-cut) the rest of each stalk.

In a bowl, toss the asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

## Sautée the asparagus.

- Garlic: Roughly chop.
- Olive oil
- Water
- Salt
- Black pepper

Set a saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil, garlic, and asparagus. Sauté briefly until garlic is aromatic, then add a few tablespoons of water and cover.

Remove the cover, and check for tenderness. Repeat adding water, covering, and checking until asparagus is just shy of done.

Remove the cover and shake the pan to emulsify the oil with any remaining water.

Correct for seasoning and serve.
