# Delivery-Style Pizza

Minimum viable pizza, cooked in round pizza pans.

## Make dough.

- Olive oil, 15 g
- Salt, 10 g
- Malt syrup, 10 g
- Yeast, 1-2 g
- Water, 325 g
- Bread flour, 500 g

In large bowl, whisk together all ingredients except flour. Adjust yeast based on time available and ambient temperature. 

Whisk in half the flour. Stir in remaining flour mix until a shaggy dough forms.

Bulk ferment, doing a few stretch-and-folds early on.

Portion out, pre-shape, cover, and let rest.

## Make sauce.

- Tomatoes, 350 g
- Tomato paste, 50 g
- Salt, 5 g
- Oregano
- Fennel pollen
- Olive oil
- Pepper

Blend tomatoes until smooth. Whisk together with remaining ingredients. Season to taste.

## Assemble and bake.

- Mozzarella, 225 g: Shredded.
- Parmesan: Grated.

Preheat oven to 475Â°, convection roast.

Stretch dough balls into large rounds, using semolina liberally to prevent sticking. Place on pan, then top.

Bake for about 12 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and just barely beginning to brown. Rotate halfway through.
