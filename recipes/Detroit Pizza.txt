# Detroit Pizza

The best pan pizza.

## Prepare dough.

- Honey, 32 g
- Olive oil, 32 g
- Salt, 16 g
- Water, 480 g
- Semolina flour, 160 g
- Yeast, 6 g
- Bread flour, 480 g

Whisk together all ingredients, except flour, in the order listed.

Stir in flour, then knead briefly to form a barely-coherent dough. The semolina will be slow to absorb water, so expect dough to look too wet at first.

Fold a few times as the dough rises, forming dough into a neat ball each time.

## Make sauce.

- Olive oil, 40 g
- Garlic, 2 cloves
- Tomatoes, 794 g
- Salt and pepper

Add garlic to oil and cook gently over low heat. Add tomatoes to pan. Use stick blender to puree sauce. Reduce until thick. Season to taste.

## Portion dough; prepare pans.

- Butter, 30 g: Melted.
- Olive oil, 30 g

A few hours before baking, divide dough in half and form into two neat balls.

Stir together butter and olive oil. Use pastry brush to grease two large Detroit-style pizza pans with mixture. Add a dough ball to each pan and flip twice to coat. Spread dough as far as possible without tearing. Allow to rest and spread again, repeating as necessary to cover bottom of pan.

## Assemble and bake.

- Oregano
- Mozzarella, 1 lb: Shredded.
- Muenster, 8 oz: Shredded.
- Parmesan, 60 g: Grated.

Preheat oven to 450Â° convection roast. Adjust rack to lower third of oven.

Toss together mozzarella, muenster, and parmesan cheeses.

Top dough with a light sprinkling of oregano. Add cheese mixture. Add other toppings as desired.

Bake for 18 minutes.

## Top with sauce.

Remove pan from oven. After a minute or so, transfer to wire rack and immediately top with 3-5 diagonal stripes of sauce. Let cool to serving temperature.
