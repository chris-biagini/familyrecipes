# Quesadillas and Beans

Sometimes you need dinner now.

## Make the quesadillas.

- 10-inch tortillas, 4
- Cheddar or jack cheese, 12 ounces
- Olive oil

Heat a large griddle to about 350ºF. Working in batches, make quesadillas, adding a bit of oil to the griddle before laying each tortilla.

## Make the refried beans.

- Olive oil, 30 g
- Garlic, 2 cloves: Roughly chopped.
- Black beans, 2 cans

Put oil and garlic in a small saucepan and sauté over medium-low heat.

Pour one can of beans, broth and all, into the saucepan. Drain off most of the broth from the other can and reserve. (You can use the now-empty first can to hold the broth.) Bring to a simmer.

Mash beans to desired consistency with a potato masher. Use reserved liquid to adjust consistency if necessary.

## Serve.

- Greek yogurt
- Hot sauce

Slice quesadillas and serve with beans, Greek yogurt (or sour cream if you have it), and hot sauce.

This is not haute cuisine by any stretch, but it's fast and the kids eat it :)
