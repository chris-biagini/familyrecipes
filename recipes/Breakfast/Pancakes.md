# Pancakes

## Prep dry ingredients.

- Flour (all-purpose), 200 g
- Sugar (white), 20 g
- Baking powder, 6 g
- Baking soda, 4 g
- Salt, 4 g
- Cinnamon, 1 g

Whisk together dry ingredients. 

## Finish batter.

- Buttermilk, 350 g
- Eggs, 2
- Olive oil (mild), 20 g
- Vanilla extract, 5 g

Make well in center of dry ingredients; add wet ingredients. Whisk to combine.

## Cook and serve.

- Blueberries: Optional.
- Chocolate chips: Optional.
- Butter
- Maple syrup

Cook on 350° griddle. Scant #24 scoops will make servings of 3 pancakes each. A very light swipe of butter on the griddle before each batch gives them a nice look.

If using inclusions, add immediately after pouring batter on griddle. Flip each pancake after the bottom has taken on enough color and holes on top begin to set without closing.

Add a thin pat of butter to each pancake as it comes off the griddle.
