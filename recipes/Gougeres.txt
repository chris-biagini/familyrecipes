# Gougères

Fancy cheese puffs.

## Make choux.

- Water, 225 g
- Unsalted butter, 75 g
- Salt, 3 g
- Flour, 150 g
- Eggs, 3

Bring the water, butter, salt to a boil in a saucepan. 

Remove from heat, add flour all at once, and mix with wooden spoon until mixture forms a ball. 

Return pan to medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1 minute to dry the mixture a bit. Aim for an internal temperature of 165-175°.

Transfer paste to food processor or stand mixer and mix briefly. Let cool to 130º.

Add the eggs one-by-one to the bowl, mixing for 10-20 seconds after each, or until well mixed.

## Finish and bake.

- Gruyere, 225 g: Shredded.
- Maldon salt

Preheat oven to 400º convection roast.

Add cheese to paste and stir with spoon until well combined.

Line two sheet pans with silicone mats. Use two teaspoons to portion dough onto pans, 15 puffs per pan. Top lightly with flaky salt.

Bake for about 23-25 minutes, rotating pans halfway through.
