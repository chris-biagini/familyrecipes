# Chocolate Chip Cookies

With browned butter and walnuts

## Prepare sugar mixture.

- Butter (unsalted), 60 g
- Sugar (brown), 150 g
- Sugar (white), 100 g
- Baking soda, 3.5 g
- Salt, 6 g

Add to mixer bowl; stir to combine.

## Brown butter and add to sugar mixture.

- Butter (unsalted), 140 g

Add butter to small saucepan. Cook gently over medium heat until solids are browned, then immediately add to sugar mixture in mixer bowl and allow to cool slightly.

## Preheat oven; prep pans.

Preheat oven to 350° with convection. Line two* half-sheet pans with parchment paper.

## Finish dough.

- Egg, 1
- Egg yolk, 1
- Vanilla extract, 10 g
- Flour (all-purpose), 250 g
- Chocolate, 250 g: Use chips or roughly-chopped bar.
- Walnuts, 75 g: Roughly chop.

Once dough mixture is mostly cooled (to around 120º or less), add egg, yolk, and vanilla extract. Whisk thoroughly, until sugar has dissolved and color has lightened.

Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.

## Portion and bake.

Portion generously with #16 disher (often blue), 12 cookies per sheet.

Bake 12-14 minutes, rotating pans halfway through. Allow to cool on rack.
