- Cinnamon, 1 tsp.
- Butter, 170 g: Cut into small pieces.

Combine all ingredients except butter in a large bowl. Stir until combined.

Cover and refrigerate, ideally overnight.

## Prepare apples.

- Apples, 3 lbs.

When sugar is just about done, turn off heat and add butter. Stir continuously. 

Add heavy cream and vanilla, continuing to stir.

Stir continuously and bring liquid to a boil, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
