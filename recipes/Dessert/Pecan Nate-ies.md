Category: Dessert
Makes: 24 bars

## Prepare pan.

Line a 9"x13" pan with parchment: cut the corners out of a large piece of parchment, creating a cross shape with a central rectangle that is the same size as the bottom of the pan. Fold the legs of the cross over the edge of the pan and crease so they stay in place.

## Prepare shortbread crust.

- Sugar (white), 140 g
- Butter (unsalted), 280 g
- Salt, 5 g
- Flour (all-purpose), 420 g

Cut room-temperature butter into small pieces and add to stand mixer bowl with sugar and salt. Turn on mixer to low. Increase speed and cream butter and sugar for 4 minutes, scraping sides after each minute. Add flour all at once, then stir using low speed until very well combined and a cohesive dough forms.

Press dough into pan, then press into a cohesive, even layer. Prick thoroughly all over with a thin chopstick, bamboo skewer, or fork.

Refrigerate at least 1 hour before baking.

## Par-bake crust.

Preheat oven to 350° with convection. Remove dough from fridge.

Bake 25 minutes. Puncture any large bubbles that form during baking with a fork. Remove from oven and set aside.

## Make topping.

- Butter (unsalted), 170 g
- Maple syrup, 170 g
- Sugar (brown), 170 g
- Vanilla extract, 10 g
- Salt, 4 g
- Pecans, 8 oz: Roughly chop.

While crust is baking, combine all ingredients in saucepan. Heat gently and stir until sugar has dissolved.

## Assemble and bake.

When crust is ready, remove pan from oven. Bring filling to a boil, and boil for one minute.

Pour filling into crust.

Bake for 15 minutes.

Let cool for a few minutes, then use parchment as a sling to remove from pan. Invert and remove parchment, then invert again onto a cooling rack. When cooled, cut into bars.

Ideally, let rest overnight at room temperature.
