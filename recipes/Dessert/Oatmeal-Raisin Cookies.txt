# Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies

With browned butter

## Prep dry ingredients.

- Rolled oats, 150 g
- All-purpose flour, 75 g
- White sugar, 75 g
- Raisins, 50 g
- Salt, 3 g
- Baking soda, 1.5 g
- Cinnamon, 1 g

Combine all ingredients in large bowl; mix well.

## Brown butter and incorporate into dough.

- Butter, 100 g
- Brown sugar, 75 g

Begin browning **half** the butter in small saucepan.

When butter is browned, add brown sugar to saucepan to prevent further cooking. Stir until sugar melts.

Add remaining butter. Stir until butter melts.

Add mixture to dry ingredients and mix well.

## Finish dough.

- Vanilla, 10 g
- Egg, 1

Combine eggs and vanilla in small bowl. Whisk thoroughly, then add to dough and stir to combine very well.

Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes, and up to 24 hours.

## Portion and bake.

Preheat oven to 350Â°.

Portion as desired. A half-ounce #60 scoop works well and makes 24 cookies.

Arrange on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.

Bake for 12 minutes. Remove from oven. Cool on pan for a few minutes, then remove and allow to cool completely.
