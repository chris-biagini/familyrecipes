# Red Beans and Rice

Vaguely reminiscent of New Orleans red beans and rice.

## Soak beans.

- Red beans, 1 lb: Check for debris.
- Water, 1500 g
- Salt, 10 g
- Vegetable bouillon, 1 Tbsp
- Soy sauce, 2 Tbsp
- Smoked paprika, 1 tsp
- Liquid smoke, 1 tsp
- Thyme, 1/2 tsp
- Oregano, 1/2 tsp
- Kombu, 1 piece

Combine beans, water, salt, and remaining ingredients in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. If short on time, use boiling water. Refrigerate if soaking overnight.

## Cook rice.

- Jasmine rice, 2 gō
- Butter, 2 Tbsp
- Water
- Salt

Add rice and butter to sauté pan and cook gently until rice is translucent. Add to rice cooker along with some salt, fill with water to the appropriate mark, then set to cook while you prepare the beans.

## Saute aromatics and cook beans.

- Olive oil, 125 g
- Red onion, 1: Chop fine.
- Red bell pepper, 1: Chop fine.
- Garlic, 4 cloves: Chop fine.

In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, pepper, and garlic and cook gently for as long as you have patience for. Add tomato paste and cook for an additional minute or so.

Add beans with kombu, spices, and soaking liquid to the pot.

To cook on stovetop: Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours. Remove kombu halfway through.

To cook in electric pressure cooker: Pressure cook for 30 minutes, then release pressure. Remove kombu, then simmer until liquid is reduced.

## Finish and serve.

- Vinegar
- Salt
- Black pepper

Use immersion blender to puree a small portion of the beans. Stir well and simmer briefly to thicken.

Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve with rice.
