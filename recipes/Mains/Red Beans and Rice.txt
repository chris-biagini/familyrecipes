# Red Beans and Rice

Vaguely reminiscent of New Orleans red beans and rice.

## Soak beans.

- Small red beans, 1 lb: Check for debris.
- Water, 1500 g
- Salt, 10 g
- Vegetable bouillon, 1 Tbsp
- Soy sauce, 2 Tbsp
- Smoked paprika, 1 tsp
- Liquid smoke, 1 tsp
- Thyme, 1/2 tsp
- Oregano, 1/2 tsp

Combine beans, water, salt, and remaining ingredients in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. If short on time, use boiling water. Refrigerate if soaking overnight.

## Cook rice.

- Jasmine rice, 2 gō
- Butter, 2 Tbsp
- Water
- Salt

Add rice and butter to sauté pan and cook gently until rice is translucent. Add to rice cooker along with some salt, fill with water to the appropriate mark, then set to cook while you prepare the beans.

## Saute aromatics and cook beans.

- Olive oil, 125 g
- Red onion, 1: Chop coarsely.
- Red bell pepper, 1: Chop coarsely.
- Garlic, 4 cloves: Chop coarsely.

In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, pepper, and garlic and cook gently until softened.

Add beans and soaking liquid to the pot. Add additional water, if necessary, to cover by one inch. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours. Alternatively, pressure cook for 30 minutes, then release pressure and boil until liquid is reduced.

## Finish and serve.

- Vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper

Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve with rice.
