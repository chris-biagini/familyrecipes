# Quesadillas and Beans

Sometimes you need dinner now.

## Make the quesadillas.

- 10-inch tortillas, 4
- Cheddar or jack cheese, 12 ounces
- Olive oil

Heat a large griddle to about 350ÂºF. Working in batches, make quesadillas, adding a bit of oil to the griddle before laying each tortilla.

## Make the beans.

- Black beans, 2 cans
- Olive oil
- Tomato salsa

Drain some, but not all, of the bean cooking liquid. Add to small pot and bring to simmer. Add olive oil to taste, which will emulsify into the simmering liquid.

## Serve.

- Greek yogurt
- Hot sauce

Slice quesadillas and serve with beans, greek yogurt, and hot sauce.

This is not haute cuisine by any stretch, but it's fast and the kids eat it :)
