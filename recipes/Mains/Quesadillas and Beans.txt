# Quesadillas and Beans

## Make the quesadillas.

- Tortillas (large), 4
- Monterey jack cheese, 12 ounces
- Olive oil

Heat a large griddle to about 350ÂºF.

Working in batches, make quesadillas, adding a bit of oil to the griddle before laying each tortilla. Let tortillas cook a bit before topping with cheese, then fold in half and continue to cook, flipping once, until tortilla is lightly browned and cheese is melted.

## Make the beans.

- Black beans (canned), 3 cans
- Olive oil
- Tomato salsa
- Cumin
- Salt

Drain most, but not all, of the bean cooking liquid. Add to small pot and bring to simmer. Add salsa, oil, and seasonings to taste.

Optionally, use an immersion blender to puree a portion of the beans.

## Serve.

- Greek yogurt
- Hot sauce

Slice quesadillas and serve with beans, greek yogurt, and hot sauce.

This is not haute cuisine by any stretch, but it's fast and the kids eat it :)
