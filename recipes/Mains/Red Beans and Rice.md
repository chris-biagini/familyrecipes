Category: Mains
Serves: 4

## Soak beans.

- Red beans (dry), 450 g: Check for debris.
- Water, 1250 g: Boiling.
- Salt, 10 g
- Vegetarian bouillon
- Soy sauce, 2 Tbsp
- Smoked paprika, 1 tsp
- Liquid smoke, 1 tsp
- Thyme, 1/2 tsp
- Oregano, 1/2 tsp
- Kombu, 1 piece

Combine beans, water, salt, and remaining ingredients in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. 

## Cook rice.

- Jasmine rice, 3 gō
- Butter, 3 Tbsp
- Water
- Salt

Add rice and butter to sauté pan and cook gently until rice is translucent. Add to rice cooker along with some salt, fill with water to the appropriate mark, then set to cook while you prepare the beans.

## Saute aromatics and cook beans.

- Olive oil, 125 g
- Onion, 1: Chop fine.
- Green bell pepper, 1: Chop fine.
- Celery, 1 stalk:  Chop fine.
- Garlic, 4 cloves: Chop fine.

In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, pepper, and garlic and cook gently for as long as you have patience for. 

Add beans with kombu, spices, and soaking liquid to the pot.

To cook on stovetop: Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours. Remove kombu halfway through. Top off with water as needed. 

To cook in electric pressure cooker: Simmer for a few minutes, then remove kombu. Pressure cook for 30 minutes, then release pressure. 

## Finish and serve.

- Vinegar (sherry)
- Salt
- Black pepper

Use immersion blender to puree a small portion of the beans. Stir well and simmer briefly to thicken.

Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve with rice.

This recipe resists being expressed entirely in metric units. 

If you're in a hurry, you can make this with two large cans of cooked red beans and eyeball the rest.
