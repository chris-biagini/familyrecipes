# Beans and Rice

Vaguely reminiscent of Cuban or Mexican beans and rice.

## Soak beans.

- Red beans, 450 g: Check for debris.
- Water, 1250 g: Boiling.
- Salt, 10 g

Combine beans, water, and salt. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. 

## Cook rice.

- Jasmine rice, 3 gō
- Olive oil, 3 Tbsp
- Vegetarian bouillon
- Water
- Salt

Add rice and oil to sauté pan and cook gently until rice is translucent. Add to rice cooker along with some salt and some bouillon, fill with water to the appropriate mark, then set to cook.

## Saute aromatics and cook beans.

- Olive oil, 125 g
- Onion, 1: Chop fine.
- Red bell pepper, 1: Chop fine.
- Garlic, 2 cloves: Chop fine.
- Mexican oregano

In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, pepper, and garlic and cook gently for as long as you have patience for. 

Add beans with soaking liquid to the pot.

To cook on stovetop: Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours. Top off with water as needed. 

To cook in pressure cooker: Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Pressure cook for 30 minutes, then release pressure. 

## Finish and serve.

- Lime
- Salt

Use immersion blender to puree a small portion of the beans. Stir well and simmer briefly to thicken.

Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve with rice.
