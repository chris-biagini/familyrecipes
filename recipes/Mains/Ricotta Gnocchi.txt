# Ricotta Gnocchi

Cheesy dumplings in tomato sauce.

## Prepare sauce.

- Olive oil, 75 g
- Onion, 100 g: Peel and finely chop.
- Carrot, 50 g: Peel and finely chop.
- Tomato passata, 500 g
- Salt
- Black pepper

In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and carrot, season lightly, and cook gently, stirring until vegetables are soft and just barely golden. Stir in tomato and simmer over low heat while preparing the gnocchi.

## Prepare gnocchi.

- Ricotta, 425 g
- Parmesan, 75 g: Grated.
- Egg, 1
- Salt, 5 g
- Flour (all-purpose), 175 g

In medium bowl, mix together Parmesan, egg, and salt. Stir in ricotta (_do not whip_), then flour. Mix thoroughly.

## Poach gnocchi and combine with sauce.

Fill a pot with water and bring to a gentle boil over high heat. 

Use small disher (#60, pink) or two spoons to drop gnocchi into water. 

Cook gnocchi until nearly doubled in size, about 2-3 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to remove from water and add to sauce.

Normally I just do garlic for sauce, but the classic onion/carrot combo works really well with the ricotta. I think it's particularly good when made with Vidalia onions.
