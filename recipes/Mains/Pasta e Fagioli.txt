# Pasta e Fagioli

Pasta and beans in broth.

## Soak beans.

- Beans, 225 g: Check for debris.
- Water, 1000 g: Boiling.
- Salt, 5 g

Combine beans, water, and salt in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. If short on time, use boiling water. Refrigerate if soaking overnight.

## Cook beans.

- Olive oil, 50 g
- Garlic, 2 cloves: Peel and roughly chop.
- Tomato paste, 30 g
- Black pepper
- Water

In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and a few grinds of pepper. Cook gently until just barely golden. Stir in the tomato paste and fry for 30 seconds or so.

Add the beans and soaking liquid to the pot. Add additional water, if necessary, to cover by one inch. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours.

## Add pasta.

- Pasta, 150 g: Ditalini or similar.
- Water

When beans are just about done, add the pasta and additional water, if necessary to maintain consistency. Continue cooking until pasta is done, about 15 minutes.

## Finish and serve.

- Vinegar (sherry)
- Salt
- Black pepper

Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve.

For Dean Martin's "pasta fazool," omit tomato, substitute an onion for the garlic, and add a pinch of cinnamon.
