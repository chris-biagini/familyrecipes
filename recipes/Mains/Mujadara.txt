## Cook rice in rice cooker.

- Garlic, 1 clove: Crushed in mortar.
- Water, 300 g: Boiling.
- Vegetable bouillon, 10 g

Add rice and oil to skillet. SautÃ© gently until rice is milky white in color. Add garlic and cook until fragrant.

Transfer rice to rice cooker along with water and bouillon. Season to taste. Cook using quick cook setting, if available.

## Caramelize onions.

- Onions, 450-500 g: Quarter, then slice thin.
- Olive oil, 75 g
- Salt
- Black pepper

Place onions and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season to taste.

Cook gently, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes or until the onions are a deep golden brown.

While onions are cooking, start lentils (see next step).

Add the lentils, water, kombu, and salt to a large saucepan. Add pepper and cumin to taste. Bring to a simmer.

Cook for 25 minutes, maintaining simmer. Allow liquid to reduce naturally, but do not let pan run dry.

Remove kombu. Cook for 5 additional minutes, allowing broth to reduce to just a scant few tablespoons.

## Make yogurt sauce in mortar.

- Garlic, 1 clove.
- Yogurt
- Water
- Lemon
- Salt

Place garlic in mortar and pound into a fine paste. Whisk in yogurt. Thin to desired consistency with water and season to taste with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

Add rice and caramelized onions (optionally setting some aside as a topping) to lentils in saucepan. Set heat to very low.

Stir gently to avoid breaking rice. Allow excess water to steam off.

## Finish and serve.

If you have some parsley, add a bit to the yogurt sauce and as a garnish at the end.
