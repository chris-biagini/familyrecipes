# Tomato Soup

Rich tomato soup with grilled cheese.

## Saute aromatics.

In large saucepan, gently saut√© onion and garlic in oil until softened.

- Tomatoes (canned), 1600 g: Two 28-ounce cans.

Open a can of tomatoes and pour it into the saucepan. (This cools everything down so you're not adding hot oil to an empty blender.)

Add bread and vegetable bouillon to saucepan and stir to combine.

Transfer contents of saucepan to blender. Puree until smooth. Return to saucepan.

Add second can of tomatoes to now-empty blender, and puree until smooth. Transfer to saucepan.

Add water to now-empty blender, pulse a few times, and transfer to saucepan. Bring soup to a gentle simmer.

## Make grilled cheese.

- Bread, 8 slices
- American cheese, 8 slices
- Butter

Preheat griddle. Add a few pats of butter and spread around with spatula.

Place down four slices of bread, top with cheese, then top with four remaining slices of bread. Grill for a few minutes, flip, and grill for a few minutes more.

## Finish and serve.

- Black pepper

Season soup to taste. Serve with grilled cheese.
