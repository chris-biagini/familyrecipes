# Pasta e Fagioli

Pasta and beans in a simple broth.

## Soak beans.

- Beans (any dry), 450 g: Check for debris.
- Water, 2000 g: Boiling.
- Salt, 10 g

Combine beans, water, and salt in a sealable container. Soak for a while.

## Cook beans.

- Olive oil, 75 g
- Onion, 1: Chopped.
- Vegetarian bouillon
- Black pepper
- Water

In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and a few grinds of pepper. Cook gently until just barely golden. Add the tiniest bit of cinnamon and cook for a few seconds, until fragrant.

Add the beans and soaking liquid to the pot. Add additional water, if necessary, to cover by one inch. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours.

## Add pasta.

- Pasta, 300 g: Ditalini or similar.
- Water

When beans are just about done, add the pasta and additional water, if necessary to maintain consistency. Continue cooking until pasta is done, about 15 minutes.

## Finish and serve.

- Salt
- Black pepper

Correct for seasoning. Serve.
