# Stovetop Mac and Cheese

Better than the box.

## Make cheese sauce.

- Milk, 425 g
- Cheddar, 450 g: Cut into cubes.
- Sodium citrate, 16 g
- Salt, 4 g

In small saucepan, combine milk, cheese, sodium citrate, and salt. Slowly heat to just under a simmer.

When cheese begins to melt, whisk continuously until sauce is smooth, or use stick blender.

## Cook pasta and combine with sauce.

- Cavatappi, 454 g

Cook pasta in salted water (a minute or two less than package directions), then drain.

Stir cheese sauce into pasta.

Cook on low heat for a minute or so, then let cool. Sauce will absorb into pasta and thicken as it cools.

Use sharp cheddar, not "extra sharp."
