# Pasta con Ceci

Pasta with chickpeas in a garlicky tomato broth

## Prepare base of garlic, oil, and tomato paste.

- Olive oil, 50 g
- Garlic, 6 cloves: Peel and roughly chop.
- Tomato paste, 125 g
- Salt
- Black pepper

In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil until it shimmers.

Add the garlic and cook, stirring until it becomes lightly browned and fragrant. Stir in the tomato paste with a pinch of salt and fry for 30 seconds or so.

## Add water, chickpeas, and pasta, then simmer until done.

- Chickpeas (canned), 2 cans: Drained and rinsed.
- Water, 4 cups: Boiling.
- Pasta, 150 g: Ditalini or similar

Add the chickpeas, pasta, and boiling water.

Stir to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, lower the heat, and simmer until the pasta is cooked and some of the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.

## Adjust consistency and seasoning.

- Water
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Pecorino
- Olive oil
- Bread

Add water to desired consistency. Taste, adjust seasoning, and serve.

Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with cheese. Optionally, toast bread, cut into points, and nestle against sides of bowls.
