# Pasta con Ceci

Pasta with chickpeas in a garlicky tomato broth

## Prepare base of garlic, oil, and tomato paste.

- Olive oil, 50 g
- Garlic, 25 g: Roughly chopped.
- Tomato paste, 125 g
- Salt
- Black pepper

Add oil and garlic to a large heavy-bottomed pot and cook gently. Stir in the tomato paste with some salt and pepper, then fry for 30 seconds or so.

## Add water, chickpeas, and pasta, then simmer until done.

- Chickpeas (canned), 2 cans: Drained and rinsed.
- Water, 1 L: Boiling.
- Pasta, 150 g: Ditalini or similar
- Salt

Add the chickpeas, stir to combine, and cook for a minute or so.

Add pasta, boiling water, and salt to taste.

Stir to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, lower the heat, and simmer until the pasta is cooked and some of the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.

## Adjust consistency and seasoning.

- Water
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Pecorino
- Olive oil
- Bread

Add water to desired consistency. Add oil, salt, and pepper to taste.

Portion into bowls, then drizzle with oil and sprinkle with cheese. Optionally, toast bread, cut into points, and nestle against sides of bowls.
