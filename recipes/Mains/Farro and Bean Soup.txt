# Farro and Bean Soup

Farro and beans in broth.

## Soak beans.

- Beans, 225 g: Check for debris.
- Salt, 6 g
- Water, 1000 g

Combine all ingredients in a stainless pot. Allow to soak for as much time as you have.

## Cook beans.

- Olive oil, 50 g
- Onion, 100 g: Coarsely chop.
- Carrot, 75 g: Coarsely chop.
- Vegetarian bouillon

Set bean pot over high heat while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

In a saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and carrot. Cook until just barely golden. Add to bean pot.

Add bouillon to bean pot.

Bring beans to a boil, boil for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer.

Cover and cook until almost done, _approximately_ 45 more minutes. Remove kombu.

## Add farro.

- Farro, 100 g
- Water

When beans are starting to soften but are not quite done, add the farro and additional water to maintain consistency.

Continue cooking until farro is done, about 20 minutes.

## Finish and serve.

- Frozen spinach, 75 g
- Lemon
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Olive oil

When farro is just about done, add frozen spinach. Let cook briefly.

Correct for acid and seasoning, and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Serve.
