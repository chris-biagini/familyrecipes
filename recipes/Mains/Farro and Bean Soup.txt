# Farro and Bean Soup

Farro and beans in broth.

## Soak beans.

- Beans, 225 g: Check for debris.
- Water, 1000 g: Boiling.
- Vegetable bouillon, 15 g
- Salt, 5 g

Combine beans, water, bouillon, and salt in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. If short on time, use boiling water. Refrigerate if soaking overnight.

## Cook beans.

- Olive oil, 50 g
- Onion, 1: Peel and coarsely chop.
- Carrot, 1: Peel and coarsely chop.
- Kombu, 1 small piece: Optional.
- Water

In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and carrot. Cook until just barely golden.

Add the beans and soaking liquid to the pot. Add additional water, if necessary, to cover by one inch. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer. Add kombu, if using.

Cover, and cook until done, about 1-2 hours. Remove kombu and begin checking for doneness after 1 hour.

## Add farro.

- Farro, 100 g
- Water

When beans are starting to soften but are not quite done, add the farro and additional water, if necessary to maintain consistency. Continue cooking until farro is done, about 15 minutes.

## Finish and serve.

- Frozen spinach: Optional.
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper

Add a small handful of frozen spinach, if using. Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve.
