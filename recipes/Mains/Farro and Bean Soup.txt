# Farro and Bean Soup

Farro and beans in broth.

## Soak beans.

- Beans, 225 g: Check for debris.
- Water, 1000 g: Boiling.
- Vegetable bouillon, 15 g
- Soy sauce, 10 g
- Salt, 5 g
- Kombu, 1 small piece: Optional.

Combine all ingredients in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have.

Refrigerate if soaking overnight.

## Cook beans.

- Olive oil, 50 g
- Onion, 1: Peel and coarsely chop.
- Carrot, 1: Peel and coarsely chop.
- Water

In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and carrot. Cook until just barely golden.

Add the beans and soaking liquid to the pot. Bring to a boil.

Boil for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer.

Cover, and cook until almost done, about 45 more minutes. Remove kombu.

## Add farro.

- Farro, 100 g
- Water

When beans are starting to soften but are not quite done, add the farro and additional water to maintain consistency.

Continue cooking until farro is done, about 20 minutes.

## Finish and serve.

- Frozen spinach, 75 g
- Lemon: Can sub vinegar.
- Salt
- Pepper

When farro is just about done, add frozen spinach. Let cook briefly.

Correct for acid and seasoning. Serve.
