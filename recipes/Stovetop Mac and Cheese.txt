# Stovetop Mac and Cheese

Better than the box.

## Make cheese sauce.

- Milk, 200 g
- Cheddar, 225 g: Cut into cubes.
- Sodium citrate, 8 g
- Salt, 2 g

In small saucepan, combine milk, cheese, sodium citrate, and salt. Slowly heat to just under a simmer.

When cheese begins to melt, use stick blender to puree sauce.

## Cook pasta and combine with sauce.

- Elbow macaroni, 225 g

Cook macaroni in salted water (a minute or two less than package directions), then drain.

Stir cheese sauce into pasta. Cook on low heat for a minute or so, then let cool. Sauce will absorb into pasta and thicken as it cools.
