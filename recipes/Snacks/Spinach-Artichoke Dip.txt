# Spinach-Artichoke Dip

Indulgent, but a crowd-pleaser.

## Cook spinach.

- Olive oil, 1 Tbsp
- Garlic, 3 cloves: Mince.
- Baby spinach, 10-12 ounces: Chop coarsely.
- Black pepper

Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add spinach, 1 handful at a time, allowing each to wilt slightly before adding next.

Cook until wilted and liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes.

## Make dip.

- Cream cheese, 8 oz: Softened.
- Gouda, 6 oz: Shredded.
- Parmesan, 3 oz: Grated.
- Artichokes (jarred), 12 oz: Drained and chopped.
- Mayonnaise, 230 g

Off heat, add cream cheese and stir until melted and combined, about 1 minute. Stir in gouda, Parmesan, artichokes, mayonnaise, pepper, and cayenne until combined. Transfer to 2-quart baking dish and smooth top with rubber spatula.

## Bake and serve.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.

Bake until spotty golden brown and bubbling around edges, about 22 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Serve.
