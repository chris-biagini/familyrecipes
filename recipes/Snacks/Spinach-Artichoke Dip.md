Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

## Bake and serve.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.

Bake until spotty golden brown and bubbling around edges, about 22 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Serve.
