# Limoncello

Italian lemon liqueur.

## Make lemon infusion.

- Everclear 151, 750 mL
- Lemons, 12-15

Peel zest from lemons using a vegetable peeler. Avoid getting any of the white pith underneath the yellow skins. You'll need a total of 180 g lemon zest.

Place zest in glass container along with alcohol. Let set at room temperature for 24 hours, agitating occasionally. Alternatively, place container in a 50Â°C sous vide bath and cook for two hours.

## Make simple syrup.

- Sugar, 480 g
- Water, 240 g

Combine water and sugar in saucepan or heatproof container. Heat gently on stovetop or in microwave, stirring until all sugar is dissolved. This will take a while.

## Combine and chill.

Wait until syrup has cooled to room temperature.

Strain out lemon skins from alcohol infusion. Combine infused alcohol and simple syrup in a large bottle. Stir to combine. Chill thoroughly.

Everclear makes for a potent drink. Everclear 151 will make an infusion at about 80 proof or 40% ABV. You can use 100-proof vodka instead, which will get you about 30% ABV.
