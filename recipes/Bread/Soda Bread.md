## Make dough.

- Flour (all-purpose), 225 g
- Flour (whole wheat), 125 g
- Rolled oats, 100 g
- Sugar (brown), 5 g
- Salt, 5 g
- Baking soda, 5 g
- Buttermilk, 365 g: Can sub 50/50 mix of yogurt and milk.

Preheat the oven to 400° F convection roast.

Chop oats in blender, leaving some texture. Whisk together with remaining dry ingredients, then quickly mix in buttermilk.

Turn dough out on table, form into round loaf, and cut a cross in the top with a knife, about half way down.

## Bake and brush with butter

- Butter, 50 g: Melted.

Place on a parchment-lined baking tray, and bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.

Transfer the loaf to a wire rack when it’s baked and brush all over with melted butter. Let cool for at least 30 minutes.
