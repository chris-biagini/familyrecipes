# Bagels

ðŸš§ A fun weekend baking project. ðŸš§

## Friday night, around 10 PM: Make poolish.

- Flour (bread), 525 g
- Water, 525 g
- Yeast, 0.5 g

Whisk together flour, water, and yeast in a medium bowl. Let sit on counter overnight.

Note that you only need 1000 g of poolish the next day; making extra now accounts for residue on your bowl and utensils.

## Saturday morning, around 10 AM: Make dough and bulk ferment.

- Poolish, 1000 g
- Malt syrup, 20 g
- Salt, 18 g
- Diastatic malt powder, 2.5 g
- Yeast, 4.5 g
- Water, 80 g
- Flour (bread), 500 g

In large bowl, combine all ingredients. _(Do not use a stand mixer, because this is a very tough dough and the mixer will break. Ask me how I know.)_

Knead _by hand_ for 5 minutes. Let dough (and yourself) rest for 20 minutes, then knead for an additional 5 minutes.

Form dough into a neat ball and place back in bowl. Cover the bowl tightly and let rise until not quite doubled.

## Saturday: Shape and refrigerate overnight.

Divide dough into twelve 130 g portions. Pre-shape portions into balls and keep covered. Let rest for 20 minutes or so.

Form each portion into a bagel by pinching through the center and stretching it into a wide ring. Place finished bagels in proofing boxes.

Cover the proofing boxes and refrigerate immediately.

## Sunday: Boil and bake.

- Water
- Malt syrup, 2 spoonfuls
- Sodium carbonate, 1 spoonful: Can sub baking soda.
- Salt, 1 spoonful
- Sesame seeds: Or other toppings.

Preheat oven to 450Â° convection roast.

Fill large pot with water. Stir in a few spoonfuls of malt syrup, a spoonful of sodium carbonate or baking soda, and a spoonful of salt. Bring to a boil.

Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper. Place seeds or other toppings in a quarter-sheet pan.

Working in batches, drop the bagels into the water and boil for 60 seconds, then flip and boil for another 60 seconds. Dip each bagel in toppings then transfer the lined sheet pans, topping-side down.

Bake for 10 minutes, then flip bagels over and rotate sheets, then bake 5-10 minutes longer.
