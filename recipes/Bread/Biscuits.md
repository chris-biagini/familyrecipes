## Prep dry ingredients; cut in butter.

- Flour (all-purpose), 320 g
- Baking powder, 16 g
- Sugar (white), 16 g
- Salt, 8 g
- Baking soda, 4 g
- Butter (unsalted), 112 g

Combine dry ingredients in bowl. Cut in butter with forks or a pastry blender. Can be refrigerated overnight at this point.

## Finish dough, portion, and bake.

- Cheddar, 200 g: Shredded. Optional.
- Buttermilk, 320 g

Stir in cheese, if using. Add buttermilk and mix until no dry spots remain. Dough will seem dry at first but should come together and have the consistency of soft cookie dough.

Preheat oven to 450° conv roast. Line a sheet pan with parchment.

Drop biscuits onto pan, about 120 g (with cheese) or 95 g (without cheese) of dough for large biscuits, half as much for small biscuits. Bake for 10-12 minutes. If not browned on top, turn on broiler and cook for a few more minutes.

If using Lodge biscuit pan, preheat in oven. Biscuits will be a little larger than called for above, so use a bit more dough for each.
