# Sourdough Bread

Worth it!

## Two nights before: Feed starter.

- Sourdough starter, 55 g: Existing, well-fed.
- Water, 55 g
- Whole-grain flour, 55 g

The night before you want to make the dough, add some existing starter to a small bowl. Mix in flour and water.

Clean starter jar, then return mixture to it. Cover and leave at room temperature overnight.

## Day before: Make dough, bulk ferment, shape, and refrigerate.

- Sourdough starter, 100 g: From above.
- Water, 300 g
- Salt, 9 g
- Bread flour, 450 g

Autolyse, around 9 AM: Take 100 g of your starter out of the jar and put it in a large bowl. Add the water, flour, and salt, then mix until no dry spots remain. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes in a proofing box or oven set to proof mode.

Three sets of folds, every half hour or so: grab an edge of the dough, lift it gently, and fold it over the top. Rotate and repeat several times. Repeat this entire process three times, allowing the dough to rest in the proofer for half an hour each time. The dough will become smoother and more extensible each time. Use a light spray of water (not flour) on your hands or the bench to prevent sticking.

Bulk fermentation, around 11 AM: Shape the dough into a neat ball, then cover and return to proofer. Allow to rise until nearly doubled in size.

Pre-shape, around 3 PM: From now on, shaping is done with flour to prevent sticking.

Dust the top of the dough and the bench with flour, then turn out dough upside down onto the bench. Divide into balls if you scaled the recipe. Each dough ball should slide freely on the bench, with the top side remaining unfloured and sticky.

Pre-shape each ball by stretching and folding from the edge and into the sticky center. Flip the ball over so the smooth side is up and the seams are on the table. Cover with cloth and let rest for 1 hour.

Final shape, around 4 PM: Lightly dust the ball, then turn it upside down onto a lightly dusted surface. The sticky side should be on top.

Gently stretch the dough into a circle, deflating any large air bubbles. Fold the side edges toward the center. Roll the dough from the top edge towards you into a sausage and stick it onto the sticky patch closest to you, pressing the seam to seal it.

Dust the loaf and an oval banneton with flour. Place the dough in the banneton upside down (seam side up). Let the dough rise for an hour and a half or so.

Final proof, around 5:30 PM: Place basket in the fridge, uncovered, to prove nice and slowly overnight.

## Day of: Bake.

- Cornmeal

When you are ready to bake, remove your loaf from the fridge and let it rest on the kitchen side while the oven preheats. It should show clear signs of inflation, don’t expect huge growth but certainly it should have plumped up since you put it in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 450°F convection roast.

Turn out the loaf out onto a floured peel and slide it into the shallow side of a Simax glass casserole. Score the top with a grignette. Mist the casserole cover and place on top of the other half.

Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the cover and bake for a further 20 minutes.

Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
