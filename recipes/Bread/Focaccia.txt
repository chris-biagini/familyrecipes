# Focaccia

Good for sandwiches!

## Make dough.

- Malt syrup, 16 g
- Olive oil, 16 g
- Salt, 16 g
- Yeast, 2 g
- Water, 512 g
- Flour (bread), 640 g

Add all ingredients except flour to bowl. Add half the flour and whisk together. Add remaining flour, then mix until thoroughly combined.

Bulk ferment for a few hours, folding occasionally during the first hour or so.

## Portion and pre-shape.

- Raisins, 65 g: Optional.
- Flour (bread), 5 g: Optional.
- Butter
- Olive oil

Divide dough in half. If using raisins, toss with flour and mix into one of the halves.

Pre-shape into ball(s) and place each ball into pan(s) greased with a little butter (to mitigate sticking) and a fair bit of olive oil. Cover and let rest, then spread dough to edges. Cover and allow to proof.

## Bake.

- Olive oil
- Maldon salt

Preheat oven to 500° convection roast and put oven rack in middle position. (Use 450° conv roast if using raisins.)

Dimple dough, then top with flaky salt and olive oil.

Bake for 8-10 minutes.

If you have time, make a poolish the night before with about half the flour and an equal quantity of water, plus a small pinch of yeast.

Olive oil and salt are all the toppings you need, but this dough makes a good base for just about any topping: olives, grapes, herbs like rosemary, marinated vegetables. Go wild.
