# Focaccia

Good for sandwiches!

## Make dough.

- Malt syrup, 12.5 g
- Olive oil, 12.5 g
- Salt, 12.5 g
- Yeast, 5 g
- Water, 400 g
- Flour (bread), 500 g

Add all ingredients except flour to bowl. Add half the flour and whisk together. Add remaining flour, then mix until thoroughly combined.

Bulk ferment for a few hours, folding occasionally during the first hour or so.

## Portion.

- Raisins, 50 g: Optional.
- Flour (bread), 5 g: Optional.

Divide dough in half, or leave whole if you prefer a thicker focaccia. If using raisins, toss with flour and mix into one of the halves.

Pre-shape into ball(s) and place each ball into pan(s) greased with butter (to mitigate sticking) and olive oil. Cover and let rest, then spread dough to edges. Cover and allow to proof.

## Bake.

- Olive oil
- Maldon salt

Preheat oven to 500° convection roast and put oven rack in middle position. (Use 450° conv roast if using raisins.)

Dimple dough, then top with flaky salt and olive oil.

Bake for 8-10 minutes.
