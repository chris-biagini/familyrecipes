# Focaccia

## Make dough.

- Olive oil, 16 g
- Salt, 16 g
- Malt syrup, 10 g
- Yeast, 5 g
- Water, 460 g
- Flour (00), 640 g

Add all ingredients except flour to bowl. Add half the flour and whisk together. Add remaining flour, then mix until thoroughly combined.

Let rest for 20-30 minutes, then knead until smooth. Form into a neat ball, return to bowl, and cover.

Bulk ferment until doubled in size.

## Portion and pre-shape.

- Raisins, 75 g: Optional.
- Butter
- Olive oil

Grease two 9x13 pans with a little butter (to prevent sticking) and a fair bit of olive oil.

Divide dough in half. For each half, gently stretch out into a large rectangle, then roll like a jelly roll. If using raisins, sprinkle them on top of one of the rectangles before rolling.

Place each piece of dough into a pan greased with a little butter (to mitigate sticking) and a fair bit of olive oil. Cover and let rest, then gently press and spread dough to edges. Cover and allow to proof.

## Bake.

- Olive oil
- Maldon salt

Preheat oven to 450Â° convection roast and put oven rack in middle position.

Dimple dough, then top with flaky salt and olive oil.

Bake for 10-15 minutes.

If you have time, make a poolish the night before with about half the flour and an equal quantity of water, plus a small pinch of yeast.

Olive oil and salt are all the toppings you need, but this dough makes a good base for just about any topping: olives, grapes, herbs like rosemary, marinated vegetables. Go wild.
