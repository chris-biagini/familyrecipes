# Focaccia

Just a little sweet.

## Make dough and bulk ferment.

- Honey, 20 g
- Olive oil, 20 g
- Salt, 10 g
- Water, 300 g
- Yeast, 5 g
- Flour (all-purpose), 400 g

Add all ingredients except flour to bowl. Add half the flour and whisk together. Add remaining flour, then mix until thoroughly combined.

Let rest for 20-30 minutes, then knead until smooth. Form into a neat ball, return to bowl, and cover.

Bulk ferment until doubled in size.

## Portion, pre-shape, and proof.

- Raisins, 100 g: Optional.
- Butter
- Olive oil

Grease a 9x13 pan with a little butter (to prevent sticking) and a fair bit of olive oil.

Laminate dough by spreading it out onto a board misted with water, then folding it into a rectangle. If using raisins, add to spread-out dough before folding.

Add dough to pan and allow to rest. Spread dough as far as possible without tearing. Cover. Allow to rest and spread again, repeating as necessary to cover bottom of pan.

Cover and allow dough to proof until puffy.

## Bake.

- Olive oil
- Maldon salt

Preheat oven to 450Â° convection roast. Adjust rack to middle position.

Drizzle dough with olive oil. Press fingers into dough. Sprinkle with Maldon salt.

Bake for 14 minutes.

Remove pan from oven. When slightly cooled, transfer to rack to cool to serving temperature. Slice and serve.

Olive oil and salt are all the toppings you need, but this dough makes a good base for just about any topping: olives, herbs, marinated vegetables. Go wild.
