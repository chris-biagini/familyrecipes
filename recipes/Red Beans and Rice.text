* Oregano, 1/2 tsp
* Liquid smoke, 1 tsp

Combine beans, water, salt, and remaining ingredients in a sealable container. Allow to soak for as much time as you have. If short on time, use boiling water. Refrigerate if soaking overnight.

Cook rice.
----------
* Jasmine rice, 2 go
* Butter, 2 Tbsp

Add rice and butter to saut√© pan and cook gently until rice is translucent. Add to rice cooker along with some salt, fill with water to the appropriate mark, then set to cook while you prepare the beans.

Saute aromatics and cook beans.

* Olive oil, 100 g
* Red onion, 1: Chop coarsely.
* Red bell pepper, 1: Chop coarsely.
* Garlic, 4 cloves: Chop coarsely.

In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, pepper, and garlic and cook gently until softened.
