# Neapolitan Pizza

Simple dough topped with tomato, fresh mozz, and basil.

## Advance Prep, around 10 am: Make dough.

- Salt, 18 g
- Yeast, 0.75 g
- Water, 375 g
- Flour (00), 640 g

Whisk together water, salt, and yeast in large bowl.

Stir in flour, then knead thoroughly until a smooth dough forms. Scrape down sides of bowl. Form dough into a neat ball, place back into bowl, and cover with damp cloth and a plate.

## Advance Prep, around 12 pm: Portion and pre-shape dough.

- Flour (semolina)

Divide dough into 250-gram portions. Form each portion into a neat ball. Place in a covered container that has been dusted with semolina flour.

## Shape, assemble, and cook.

- Tomatoes (canned), 400 g
- Salt, 4 g
- Basil, 1 bunch
- Parmesan
- Pecorino
- Mozzarella (fresh), 400 g
- Olive oil
- Flour (semolina)

Preheat pizza oven at maximum setting. Oven is ready to cook when floor reads about 850ÂºF. Optionally, set indoor oven to warm.

Using semolina to prevent sticking, stretch each dough ball into a pizza base. Top with tomato sauce, basil, parmesan, mozzarella, and oil.

Cook each pizza for about 90 seconds, rotating at approximately the 30-second and 1-minute marks.
