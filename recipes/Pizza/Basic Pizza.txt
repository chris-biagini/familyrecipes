# Basic Pizza

Minimum viable pizza.

## Make dough.

- Olive oil, 32 g
- Salt, 16 g
- Malt syrup, 12.8 g
- Yeast, 2 g
- Water, 384 g
- Flour (00), 640 g

In large bowl, whisk together all ingredients except flour. Adjust yeast based on time available and ambient temperature.

Whisk in half the flour. Stir in remaining flour mix until a shaggy dough forms.

Bulk ferment, doing a few stretch-and-folds early on.

Portion out, pre-shape, cover, and let rest.

## Make sauce.

- Tomato passata, 385 g
- Tomato paste, 15 g
- Oregano
- Fennel pollen
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Black pepper

Whisk ingredients together. Season to taste.

## Assemble and bake.

- Mozzarella, 225 g: Shredded.
- Parmesan: Grated.
- Pecorino: Grated.
- Bocconcini: Optional.

Preheat oven to 500Â°, convection roast.

Stretch dough balls into large rounds, using semolina liberally to prevent sticking. Place on pan, then add cheese and top with dollops of sauce.

Bake for about 12 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and just barely beginning to brown. Rotate halfway through.
