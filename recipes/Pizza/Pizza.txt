# Pizza

- Water, 315 g
- Yeast, 0.2 g

Whisk together flour, water, and yeast in a medium bowl. Let sit on counter overnight.

Note that you only need 600 g of poolish the next day; making extra now accounts for residue on your bowl and utensils.

- Water, 75 g
- Salt, 18 g
- Yeast, 0.75 g
- Flour (00), 340 g

Stir together poolish, water, salt, and yeast in mixer bowl.

Stir in flour, then knead thoroughly until a smooth dough forms. Scrape down sides of bowl. Form dough into a neat ball, place back into bowl, and cover with damp cloth and a plate.

## Advance Prep, around 12 pm: Portion and pre-shape dough.

Whisk ingredients together. Season to taste.

## Shape, assemble, and cook.

- Mozzarella (low-moisture), 400 g

Preheat pizza oven at maximum setting. Oven is ready to cook when floor reads about 850ÂºF.

Using cornmeal and flour to prevent sticking, stretch each dough ball into a pizza base. Top with tomato sauce, cheeses, and oil.

Cook each pizza for about 90 seconds, rotating at approximately the 30-second and 1-minute marks.
