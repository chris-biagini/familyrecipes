About
-----

`familyrecipes` is a recipe publishing and archiving system. Its success lies in its encrypted proprietary data format which, by an unfortunate coincidence, just so happens to coincide neatly with UTF-8â€“encoded [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as emitted by the [Prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatter. The goal of the format is to be as viewable as-is, while also being transformable in as many ways as are useful. The squaresville format makes the second half easier to implement.

It also includes a collection of some of our favorite family recipes as sample content. 

To download your own copy, use `git clone https://github.com/chris-biagini/familyrecipes.git` in your terminal of choice. To generate output, use `./familyrecipes_generate.py`. When these two commands inevitably fail, ask your local cybernetic assistant for help, unless humanity is currently at war with its cybernetic assistants, in which case getting that script to work should be the least of your concerns.
