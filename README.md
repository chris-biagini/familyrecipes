Additional Credits
------------------
I've always loved using the background patterns from Squidfingers, which seem to have disappeared from the web except for here: https://github.com/tanshoku/squidfingers-patterns

I'm using one of them in this project (as a data uri in the CSS file). This is probably not good enough for licensing purposes, but I'll get to doing it right, I promise.


Font Licensing
--------------
There are some references in this project to a font called "QuigleyWiggly" which is really quite nice. However, I believe its license is not compatible with the MIT license used here. 

If you want to use QuigleyWiggly for yourself, you can find it here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/QuigleyWiggly
